Two other projects can be viewed on my GitHub: https://github.com/ProValdi



# Render3D
Simple 3D render engine on Java.
It is worth noting that game engines or third-party libraries like Java OpenGL are not used here. In the application you can display and rotate a sphere, a tetrahedron, a cube and a triangular pyramid. Also, these shapes can be painted in any color you want.

# How to run ?
To run the program you need at least fresh (elective point) JRE.

**Linux:**

type in console:

```
java -jar Render3D.jar 
```
**Windows:**

I guess double click on the file will works fine
